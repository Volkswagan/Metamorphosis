### Answers and Explanations:

**1. B) Aortic dissection; initiate IV beta-blockers and prepare for surgery**  
   *Explanation*: Sudden chest pain with a differential in blood pressure between arms suggests aortic dissection, which requires beta-blockers to reduce shear forces and surgery.

**2. A) Primary syphilis; benzathine penicillin G**  
   *Explanation*: A painless ulcer with positive VDRL indicates primary syphilis, which is treated with benzathine penicillin G.

**3. A) Administer magnesium sulfate and induce labor**  
   *Explanation*: Severe preeclampsia at 34 weeks requires magnesium sulfate to prevent seizures and prompt delivery to prevent maternal and fetal complications.

**4. C) ACE inhibitors**  
   *Explanation*: ACE inhibitors improve survival in heart failure patients by reducing afterload and preventing cardiac remodeling.

**5. C) Piperacillin-tazobactam and ciprofloxacin**  
   *Explanation*: Pseudomonas infections in neutropenic patients are treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics like piperacillin-tazobactam and ciprofloxacin.

**6. B) Wernicke’s encephalopathy**  
   *Explanation*: Confusion, ophthalmoplegia, and ataxia are classic symptoms of Wernicke’s encephalopathy, which responds to thiamine administration.

**7. C) Secure the airway in the operating room**  
   *Explanation*: The tripod position and stridor in a child suggest epiglottitis, a life-threatening condition that requires immediate airway management.

**8. A) Administer IV calcium gluconate**  
   *Explanation*: In hyperkalemia with ECG changes, IV calcium gluconate is given to stabilize the cardiac membrane, reducing the risk of life-threatening arrhythmias. Insulin and glucose may follow to lower serum potassium.

**9. B) Subarachnoid hemorrhage; perform lumbar puncture**  
   *Explanation*: A severe headache with normal CT suggests a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). A lumbar puncture is the next step to check for xanthochromia (blood breakdown products), which confirms SAH.

**10. A) Acute hepatitis A; supportive care**  
   *Explanation*: Acute hepatitis A presents with jaundice, elevated liver enzymes, and anti-HAV IgM positivity. There is no specific treatment beyond supportive care, as it is self-limiting.

**11. A) Neonatal hypoglycemia; administer IV dextrose**

The initial treatment involves administering IV vancomycin and ceftriaxone to cover the most likely pathogens, including pneumococcus and meningococcus.

**58. Answer: B) Tension pneumothorax**  
	*Explanation*: The presentation of sudden hypotension, decreased breath sounds on one side, and tracheal deviation indicates tension pneumothorax, where air accumulates in the pleural space and pushes the mediastinum towards the opposite side, compromising respiratory function and cardiovascular stability.

**59. Answer: A) Start non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV)**  
	*Explanation*: The patient is exhibiting signs of acute respiratory failure, likely due to COPD exacerbation. NIPPV is indicated to help improve ventilation and reduce CO2 levels without the need for intubation. It is more comfortable for the patient and can prevent the need for invasive ventilation.

**60. Answer: B) Start IV fluids and calcium gluconate**  
	*Explanation*: In calcium channel blocker overdose, hypotension and bradycardia are common. The first-line treatment includes IV fluids to support blood pressure and calcium gluconate to counteract the effects of the overdose, as calcium can help restore cardiac function. Activated charcoal may be considered if the ingestion was recent, but the immediate concern is stabilizing the patient's hemodynamics.

 **61. C) Myocardial infarction (inferior wall)**  
*Explanation*: STsegment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF indicates an inferior wall myocardial infarction, likely due to occlusion of the right coronary artery.
