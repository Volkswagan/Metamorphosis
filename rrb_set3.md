### Answers and Explanations:

1. **B) Aortic dissection; initiate IV beta-blockers and prepare for surgery**  
   *Explanation*: Sudden chest pain with a differential in blood pressure between arms suggests aortic dissection, which requires beta-blockers to reduce shear forces and surgery.

2. **A) Primary syphilis; benzathine penicillin G**  
   *Explanation*: A painless ulcer with positive VDRL indicates primary syphilis, which is treated with benzathine penicillin G.

3. **A) Administer magnesium sulfate and induce labor**  
   *Explanation*: Severe preeclampsia at 34 weeks requires magnesium sulfate to prevent seizures and prompt delivery to prevent maternal and fetal complications.

4. **C) ACE inhibitors**  
   *Explanation*: ACE inhibitors improve survival in heart failure patients by reducing afterload and preventing cardiac remodeling.

5. **C) Piperacillin-tazobactam and ciprofloxacin**  
   *Explanation*: Pseudomonas infections in neutropenic patients are treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics like piperacillin-tazobactam and ciprofloxacin.

6. **B) Wernicke’s encephalopathy**  
   *Explanation*: Confusion, ophthalmoplegia, and ataxia are classic symptoms of Wernicke’s encephalopathy, which responds to thiamine administration.

7. **C) Secure the airway in the operating room**  
   *Explanation*: The tripod position and stridor in a child suggest epiglottitis, a life-threatening condition that requires immediate airway management.


8. **A) Administer IV calcium gluconate**  
   *Explanation*: In hyperkalemia with ECG changes, IV calcium gluconate is given to stabilize the cardiac membrane, reducing the risk of life-threatening arrhythmias. Insulin and glucose may follow to lower serum potassium.


9. **B) Subarachnoid hemorrhage; perform lumbar puncture**  
   *Explanation*: A severe headache with normal CT suggests a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). A lumbar puncture is the next step to check for xanthochromia (blood breakdown products), which confirms SAH.


10. **A) Acute hepatitis A; supportive care**  
   *Explanation*: Acute hepatitis A presents with jaundice, elevated liver enzymes, and anti-HAV IgM positivity. There is no specific treatment beyond supportive care, as it is self-limiting.


11. **A) Neonatal hypoglycemia; administer IV dextrose**  
   *Explanation*: Neonates of diabetic mothers are prone to hypoglycemia due to hyperinsulinism. Symptoms include lethargy and tremors, and treatment is IV dextrose to restore normal blood glucose levels.


12. **A) Renal cell carcinoma; nephrectomy**  
   *Explanation*: A flank mass, hematuria, and weight loss suggest renal cell carcinoma. Surgery (nephrectomy) is the mainstay of treatment in operable cases.


13. **B) Abdominal ultrasound with Doppler**  
   *Explanation*: Ascites, jaundice, and elevated liver enzymes suggest liver cirrhosis. Ultrasound with Doppler helps assess liver structure, portal hypertension, and vascular flow.


14. **A) Start non-invasive positive pressure ventilation**  
   *Explanation*: The patient with COPD has acute hypercapnic respiratory failure (pH 7.30, PaCO2 58 mmHg). Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) helps improve gas exchange and reduce CO2 retention.


15. **A) Levothyroxine**  
   *Explanation*: Elevated TSH and low free T4 indicate hypothyroidism. Levothyroxine is the standard treatment to replace deficient thyroid hormone.


**16. A) Charcot's triad**  
   *Explanation*: Charcot's triad (fever, abdominal pain, and jaundice) is associated with cholangitis, an infection of the bile ducts often caused by gallstones.

**17. A) Ectopic pregnancy**  
   *Explanation*: An elevated beta-hCG level with no intrauterine pregnancy on ultrasound is highly suspicious for an ectopic pregnancy, a medical emergency.

**18. A) Beta-blocker and anticoagulation**  
   *Explanation*: Patients with mitral stenosis and atrial fibrillation should receive a beta-blocker to control heart rate and anticoagulation to prevent thromboembolism.

**19. A) IV regular insulin**  
   *Explanation*: Diabetic ketoacidosis is treated with IV regular insulin to lower blood glucose and correct the metabolic acidosis.

**20. C) Heparin followed by warfarin**  
   *Explanation*: DVT is managed with anticoagulation, starting with heparin for immediate effect, followed by warfarin for long-term prevention of clot formation.

**21. B) Family history of epilepsy**  
   *Explanation*: A family history of epilepsy is a known risk factor for the recurrence of febrile seizures in pediatric patients.

**22. D) Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine**  
   *Explanation*: Live vaccines, such as MMR, are contraindicated during pregnancy due to the risk of fetal infection.

**23. C) Discontinue thiazide diuretic and observe**  
   *Explanation*: Mild hyponatremia caused by thiazide diuretics often resolves after discontinuation of the drug. Observation is the appropriate management in asymptomatic patients.

**24. A) Ursodeoxycholic acid**  
   *Explanation*: Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy presents with pruritus and elevated bile acids. Ursodeoxycholic acid is the treatment of choice to improve bile flow.

**25. A) Endovascular stent grafting**  
   *Explanation*: For thoracic aortic aneurysms greater than 5.5 cm, endovascular stent grafting is the definitive treatment to prevent rupture.

**26. B) Dermoid cyst (teratoma)**  
   *Explanation*: Dermoid cysts (teratomas) are the most common ovarian tumors in young women and are usually benign.

**27. A) Pulmonary embolism**  
   *Explanation*: Sudden onset chest pain and dyspnea following surgery is highly suggestive of a pulmonary embolism, which is a surgical complication.

**28. A) Hydrocephalus**  
   *Explanation*: Bulging fontanelles and widely spaced sutures in a newborn suggest increased intracranial pressure, most likely due to hydrocephalus.

**29. A) Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy**  
   *Explanation*: Barrett's esophagus is treated with PPIs to prevent progression to esophageal adenocarcinoma, with endoscopic surveillance for dysplasia.

**30. A) Desquamation of the skin on the hands and feet**  
   *Explanation*: Kawasaki disease is characterized by fever, mucocutaneous inflammation, and peeling of the skin on the hands and feet.
