### Answers and Explanations:

1. **B) Aortic dissection; initiate IV beta-blockers and prepare for surgery**  
   *Explanation*: Sudden chest pain with a differential in blood pressure between arms suggests aortic dissection, which requires beta-blockers to reduce shear forces and surgery.

2. **A) Primary syphilis; benzathine penicillin G**  
   *Explanation*: A painless ulcer with positive VDRL indicates primary syphilis, which is treated with benzathine penicillin G.

3. **A) Administer magnesium sulfate and induce labor**  
   *Explanation*: Severe preeclampsia at 34 weeks requires magnesium sulfate to prevent seizures and prompt delivery to prevent maternal and fetal complications.

4. **C) ACE inhibitors**  
   *Explanation*: ACE inhibitors improve survival in heart failure patients by reducing afterload and preventing cardiac remodeling.

5. **C) Piperacillin-tazobactam and ciprofloxacin**  
   *Explanation*: Pseudomonas infections in neutropenic patients are treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics like piperacillin-tazobactam and ciprofloxacin.

6. **B) Wernicke’s encephalopathy**  
   *Explanation*: Confusion, ophthalmoplegia, and ataxia are classic symptoms of Wernicke’s encephalopathy, which responds to thiamine administration.

7. **C) Secure the airway in the operating room**  
   *Explanation*: The tripod position and stridor in a child suggest epiglottitis, a life-threatening condition that requires immediate airway management.


8. **A) Administer IV calcium gluconate**  
   *Explanation*: In hyperkalemia with ECG changes, IV calcium gluconate is given to stabilize the cardiac membrane, reducing the risk of life-threatening arrhythmias. Insulin and glucose may follow to lower serum potassium.


9. **B) Subarachnoid hemorrhage; perform lumbar puncture**  
   *Explanation*: A severe headache with normal CT suggests a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). A lumbar puncture is the next step to check for xanthochromia (blood breakdown products), which confirms SAH.


10. **A) Acute hepatitis A; supportive care**  
   *Explanation*: Acute hepatitis A presents with jaundice, elevated liver enzymes, and anti-HAV IgM positivity. There is no specific treatment beyond supportive care, as it is self-limiting.


11. **A) Neonatal hypoglycemia; administer IV dextrose**  
   *Explanation*: Neonates of diabetic mothers are prone to hypoglycemia due to hyperinsulinism. Symptoms include lethargy and tremors, and treatment is IV dextrose to restore normal blood glucose levels.


12. **A) Renal cell carcinoma; nephrectomy**  
   *Explanation*: A flank mass, hematuria, and weight loss suggest renal cell carcinoma. Surgery (nephrectomy) is the mainstay of treatment in operable cases.


13. **B) Abdominal ultrasound with Doppler**  
   *Explanation*: Ascites, jaundice, and elevated liver enzymes suggest liver cirrhosis. Ultrasound with Doppler helps assess liver structure, portal hypertension, and vascular flow.


14. **A) Start non-invasive positive pressure ventilation**  
   *Explanation*: The patient with COPD has acute hypercapnic respiratory failure (pH 7.30, PaCO2 58 mmHg). Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) helps improve gas exchange and reduce CO2 retention.


15. **A) Levothyroxine**  
   *Explanation*: Elevated TSH and low free T4 indicate hypothyroidism. Levothyroxine is the standard treatment to replace deficient thyroid hormone.
