### Answers and Explanations:

1. **C) Order a CT pulmonary angiogram**  
   *Explanation*: A CT pulmonary angiogram is the gold standard for diagnosing pulmonary embolism (PE) in a patient with high clinical suspicion.

2. **C) Administer epinephrine and prepare for possible intubation**  
   *Explanation*: Swelling of the lips and tongue suggests angioedema, a life-threatening side effect of ACE inhibitors. Immediate administration of epinephrine is required.

3. **B) Administer glucagon intramuscularly**  
   *Explanation*: In unconscious hypoglycemic patients, glucagon is administered IM when IV access is not available.

4. **C) MRI of the brain**  
   *Explanation*: Elevated prolactin levels with galactorrhea and amenorrhea suggest a prolactinoma, which requires MRI for diagnosis.

5. **A) Administer lactulose**  
   *Explanation*: Elevated serum ammonia levels indicate hepatic encephalopathy. Lactulose is used to reduce ammonia levels by promoting its excretion.

6. **C) Hyponatremia; administer hypertonic saline**  
   *Explanation*: Severe hyponatremia requires immediate correction with hypertonic saline to prevent neurological complications.

7. **A) Administer broad-spectrum antibiotics**  
   *Explanation*: The patient likely has neutropenic sepsis, requiring immediate antibiotic therapy to prevent septic shock.

8. **B) Administer corticosteroids and nebulized epinephrine**  
   *Explanation*: Croup with low oxygen saturation requires treatment with nebulized epinephrine and corticosteroids to reduce airway inflammation.

9. **A) Hemoglobin level of 13 g/dL**  
   *Explanation*: Erythropoietin therapy should be discontinued if hemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dL due to increased risk of thromboembolic events.

10. **B) Placental abruption; prepare for emergency C-section**  
   *Explanation*: Severe abdominal pain with late decelerations in fetal heart rate suggests placental abruption, an obstetric emergency requiring immediate C-section.

11. **B) Proteinuria on urinalysis**  
   *Explanation*: Proteinuria suggests renal involvement, which is concerning for rheumatoid vasculitis, a severe complication of rheumatoid arthritis.

12. **A) Neisseria meningitidis; start IV ceftriaxone**  
   *Explanation*: Cloudy CSF with low glucose and high protein suggests bacterial mening
