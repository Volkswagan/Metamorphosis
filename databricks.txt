Sure, here’s a detailed overview addressing your questions:

1. **Cluster Configuration for 100 GB of Data:**
   - **Determine Data Size Per Partition:** Check the size of data partitions. Ideally, partitions should be between 128 MB and 1 GB to balance between parallelism and overhead.
   - **Choose Instance Type and Count:** Select instance types based on your workload's requirements. For 100 GB of data, you might start with 4-8 nodes with memory optimized instances (like `r5` or `m5` in AWS). Adjust based on performance testing.
   - **Specify Executor and Core Configurations:** Ensure each executor has sufficient memory to hold its portion of data. For instance, if using `r5.xlarge` instances with 32 GB memory, you might configure 4-8 cores and 4-8 executors per node depending on your job's characteristics.

2. **Submission and Internal Spark Workings:**
   - **Submission:** When you submit a job, Spark sends the job to the cluster manager (like YARN or Kubernetes) which then allocates resources (executors).
   - **Spark Workings:** Spark creates a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) of stages and tasks. The driver schedules tasks and distributes them across executors. Executors perform the tasks, shuffle data if needed, and return results.

3. **Driver Memory and Spilling:**
   - **Driver Memory:** This is the memory allocated to the driver process, which handles job scheduling and task coordination.
   - **Spilling to Disk:** Driver memory spills to disk when the driver's memory usage exceeds its allocated memory, particularly for large data structures or when the job's metadata exceeds available memory.

4. **Memory Manager:**
   - **Function:** Spark’s memory manager manages memory allocation for execution (storing RDD partitions) and storage (caching and shuffling).
   - **Components:** It includes Unified Memory Management (for combining execution and storage) and manages memory using spillable structures to disk to prevent out-of-memory errors.

5. **Out of Memory (OOM) Exceptions:**
   - **Driver Node:** OOM occurs if the driver tries to hold too much data or perform large operations in memory (e.g., large collect operations).
   - **Executor Node:** OOM occurs when an executor runs out of memory due to handling large partitions, insufficient memory allocation, or excessive shuffling.

6. **Executor Memory:**
   - **Definition:** Executor memory is allocated to each executor for task execution and storage.
   - **Distribution:** It is divided between storage (for caching) and execution (for processing tasks).
   - **Spilling to Disk:** Executors spill data to disk when the in-memory storage or execution data exceeds the available memory.

7. **Pools in Databricks:**
   - **Definition:** Pools are a set of idle, reusable virtual machines that can be used to provision clusters faster and reduce cluster start times.
   - **Use:** Pools help manage cluster resources efficiently and reduce the cost of frequently created clusters.
   - **Creation:** Pools can be created in the Databricks workspace UI under the "Pools" section by specifying the pool name, instance types, and size.

8. **Workloads on Standard Clusters:**
   - **Types:** Standard clusters can handle a range of workloads including ETL jobs, data exploration, data analysis, and model training. They are typically used for batch processing and general-purpose jobs.

9. **Types of Clusters and Choosing the Right One:**
   - **Types:** Databricks offers Standard, High-Concurrency, and Single Node clusters. Standard is for general use, High-Concurrency is optimized for concurrent workloads, and Single Node is for debugging.
   - **Choosing:** Select based on workload type. For interactive queries or many concurrent users, High-Concurrency is ideal. For general batch processing, Standard clusters work well.

10. **Cluster Modes:**
    - **Modes:** Databricks clusters operate in Standard, High-Concurrency, and Single Node modes.
    - **Purpose:** Standard for general-purpose workloads, High-Concurrency for concurrent query execution, and Single Node for local development and debugging.

11. **Databricks Runtimes:**
    - **Types:** Databricks Runtimes include the standard runtime, the ML runtime (optimized for machine learning), and the Photon runtime (optimized for performance). Each runtime is tailored for different types of workloads.

12. **Calling One Notebook from Another:**
    - **Method:** Use `%run /path/to/other/notebook` to execute another notebook’s code in the current notebook. This imports variables and functions from the other notebook.

13. **Accessing Variables from Another Notebook:**
    - **Method:** Use `%run /path/to/other/notebook` to access variables and functions defined in the other notebook.

14. **Exiting a Notebook and Returning Output Data:**
    - **Method:** Use `dbutils.notebook.exit()` to return output data from a notebook, which can then be accessed by the calling notebook.

15. **Creating Internal and External Tables:**
    - **Internal Tables:** Created using SQL `CREATE TABLE ...` command without specifying external storage. The table data is managed within the Databricks workspace.
    - **External Tables:** Created using SQL `CREATE TABLE ... USING ... LOCATION ...` command, where you specify an external location (e.g., S3 bucket or ADLS) where data is stored.

Here are one-liner definitions for each of the terms you've requested:

### 1. Data Warehouse vs. Data Lake vs. Data Mart
- **Data Warehouse**: A centralized repository optimized for storing and querying structured data from various sources for business intelligence and reporting.
- **Data Lake**: A storage system designed to hold vast amounts of raw data in its native format, supporting structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data for various analytics workloads.
- **Data Mart**: A subset of a data warehouse tailored to meet the needs of a specific department or business line, often optimized for quick querying and reporting.

### 2. Fact Table
- **Fact Table**: A central table in a star or snowflake schema that stores quantitative data (facts) for analysis and is linked to dimension tables.

- **Dimension Table**: A table in a star or snowflake schema that stores attributes (dimensions) related to the data in a fact table, providing context for analysis.

### 4. Star Schema
- **Star Schema**: A database schema design that organizes data into fact and dimension tables, with the fact table at the center and dimension tables radiating outward like a star.
